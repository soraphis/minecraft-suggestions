## Tinker's Refined 3D Printer

**Requirements**

- Refined Storage
- Tinker's Constructs

A mod that adds 2 Blocks (Crafting Stations) to Work with `Tinker's Constructs` Liquids and Tool Crafting.

### 3D Printer

This Block needs to be connected to a `Refined Storage` Liquid Storage and has a similar UI to the Tinker's `Tool Station`.

You choose the desired Tool from a list, then you choose a Liquid Type for each part from your Liquid Storage.
No need for Tinker's Constructs `Patterns`.

### Digital Liquid Fuser

This Block needs to be connected to a `Refined Storage` Liquid Storage and has a similar UI to the Refined Storage `Crafting Grid` - except designed for Liquids.

This Grid allows to create Alloys from your digital stored Tinker's Constructs Liquids.


## Storage Drawers: Small Compaction

**Requirements**

- [Storage Drawers](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/storage-drawers)

Adding a `Compacting Drawer` with 4 instead of 3 slots, for things that have only one compaction level (e.g. Redstone: Dust -> Block)

___ 

## Skyland Progression

**Recommended Additional Mods**

- [Tree Chopper](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tree-chopper) or similar
- [Quick Leaf Decay](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/quick-leaf-decay)
- [YUNoMakeGoodMap](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/yunomakegoodmap)

An `Ex Nihilo` alternative, with a less overpowered progression path.
Starting on a Skyblocks World 3x3 Dirt with a Tree.

**Main Components**

- Barrels
- Sieves and Water Strainers
- 

## Barrels

Are used to turn Plant Matter (Leafs, Saplings, ...) into Podzol.

## Sieves

Are Slab-like Blocks - no UI. Place a Block into it to sieve it. To work the sieve needs below and above it air.
Most Blocks that can be sieved have some remains that drop at the top of the sieve.

The sieves don't have 100% success chance, and the top output is kind of a bonus (like Sag Mill of Ender IO has).

| Input | Bottom Output | Top Output |
| ----| --- | --- |
| Podzol | Coarse Dirt | Seeds, Bonemeal |
| Coarse Dirt | Dirt | Gravel |
| Dirt | Sand |  |
| Gravel | Sand | Cobblestone (low chance) |
| ... | ... | ... |

Sieving a Block takes - depending on the Block - an amount of Redstone Pulses. 

### Sieve Upgrades

 1. Wood Sieve (basis)
 2. Iron Sieve
    - Now a full Block, does not need air below anymore
 3. Redstone Sieve
    - Does not need a Redstone Pulse anymore
 4. Diamond Sieve
 5. Machine Sieve <sup><sup><sup>(needs Ender IO)</sup></sup></sup>
 6. Solarium Sieve <sup><sup><sup>(needs Ender IO)</sup></sup></sup>


### Mesh Upgrades

the Level of the Mesh must be lower than the level of the Sieve you want to insert it into
