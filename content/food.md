# Food Problem

## Worthless Foods in Minecraft

Most foods in Minecraft are either worthless or overpowered in comparisson to the time and effort it takes you to farm the foods.


Foods have two properties `Food Points` and `Saturation` without diving much into this you can easily remember:

> Nourishment is defined as the ratio of saturation to hunger points restored. Foods with higher nourishment values should be eaten when the hunger bar is more full.

So to find the "best food" we only need to concentrate at foods with a high nourishment, because in case we have a farm that can produce this food our hunger bar should never deplete.


## The Best Food

The best nourishment have the golden foods (golden carrot, golden apple, enchanted golden apple).

The question is: can we farm one of those?

Its not really possible to farm apples effectively, but carrots is no problem.

Combine that with an Zombie Pigman farm for gold nuggets and you found the perfect food.

Assuming you don't want to spend gold on your food, you want to eat Steak or Porkchops. Both have a pretty high nourishment and a pretty high amount of food points.

both can be farmed pretty easy:

in case of the steak, you need to farm wheat (which shouldn't be a problem, because of its high availability). and you need to find to find a few cows (at least two).

then build a [cow farm like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNG1wljxLLY)

and you'll have on-demand steak and you'll probably never run out of it.

## Extravagant Meals

What about meals that have many different ingredients or are hard to farm?

First in this category is the rabbit stew, which is a pretty nice meal, indeat, BUT:

carrot farm, rabbit farm, potato farm, mushroom farm.

the rabbit farm plus potato farm is the same work as in the cow farm mentioned above. the carrot farm is a bit of extra work. the mushroom farm is a lot of manual extra work.

this food is not stackable, not even to 16.

it has 10 food and 12 saturation. exactly double the amount of a baked potato (which results in the same nourishment value).

you can carry 64 baked potatoes in one stack, which means even if you automate the rabbit farm as much as possible, crafting it would be annoying (since it does not stack) and it will spam your inventory.

and if your hunger bar is pretty full you'd be better off with a golden carrot... or a steak. see the steak farm above, which is way less work.

**Cake**, needs a suggar cane farm, a few cows, a few chickens and a wheat farm.

you need to place it before you eat it, and its only worth it if your hunger bar is pretty empty.

**Pumpkin Pie**: Pumpkin farm, suggar cane farm, chickens.

bread is easier and better. the pie is not bad, but the amount of work ... just make a auto-cooking chicken farm and skip the suggar cane and pumpkin farm. this would be much easier.

## Suggestions

Extravagant meals should give status effects.

Foods should be worth more if it takes more steps/time/ressources to get them.
