## General Minecraft (1.13) Feedback / Criticism

____

### [1] To high food-availability.

 - fishes everywhere -> see 'OverPowered fishing rod' 
 - Kelp -> see 'Kelp, kelp, kelp'

 
##### Kelp, kelp, kelp
 
Kelp is an overpowerd **food**.

While it does not saturate that much hunger, it has an extremely high availability. 
 
Kelp roots should generate a random number between 3 and `kelp max height`. each kelp you place on top of it reduces the value by one. kelp does not grow heigher if the top has reached 0.

This makes it so, that not all kelps grow up to the ocean surface. making kelp less available, harder to farm and more visual diverse.

Kelp is an overpowered **fuel**. You don't need coal for the furnace anymore. which also makes it an extremely "easy" xp farm.

Furnaces should smelt twice as fast (as kelp) with coal (1.5x for charcoal) and three times as fast with lava. so its more beneficial to use coal if it has to go fast.

##### Treasuremaps

to many treasuremaps point to the same treasure. couldn't there be a simple bijection betweeen chunks, so that each treasure-map chunk points to an own treasure chunk?

##### OverPowered fishing rod

afk fish farms are still op, fishing could be reworked all together.

My initial suggestion would be: 

- Fishes flee when damaged (like other animals)
- Fishing rods fire their bobber like harpunes - unaffected by water
- Fishing rods do 0 damage, but do 1 damage to fishes/crates^*.
    - Lure: Increases the chance that fishes don't flee when damaged.
- Fishs take 0 damage from weapons except the rod, they have 3-5 HP.
- Fishes drop fish on death (like now) and are a food source - but you need the fishing rod.
- Crates are like fishes, but more rare. you find small wooden crates on shores (swimming on the water surface) or iron and gold crates on ocean floors. 
    - crates drop [treasure and junk](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fishing). 
    - wood crates have a 80% chance of dropping junk (10% wooden planks, 10% treasure)
    - iron crates have a 60% cahnce of dropping junk (1% iron block, 9% iron ingot, 30% treasure).
    - gold crates have a  0% cahnce of dropping junk (1% gold block, 9% gold ingot, 90% treasure).

those changes make a) fishes a bit less accessable as they are right now as food source and b) make fishing an exploration task. 
	

##### OverPowered mob farms

just saying....

this has mainly todo with how XP works, and because mobs have drops.

### [2] Sub-Biomes and Underground Biomes

This is an addition to the <a href="#village">villages</a> suggestion. Where Villages would be "Sub-Biomes".

Each Chunk has additionally to its biome the possibility to roll a either a "sub-biome" or an "underground biome".

##### Sub-Biomes

Sub biomes are things like: 

- village:
    - this chunk is a part of a village (see other suggestion)
    - the type of the village (sand, plains, ... basically the building blocks) is determined by the biome (as is).
- temple:
    - possible on deserts, ocean, jungle, dark-forest, nether
    - those are chunks that are part of the respective temple strucutres (woodland mansion, desert temple, ...)
    - also used for strongholds
- ravine
- ruins
    - used for underwater ruins (but could be extended later)


the largest benefit those sub-biomes would give is better world generation. no more broken villages.

##### Underground Biomes

[see this](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/6s2l5i/for_a_game_called_minecraft_we_sure_havent_had_a/)


This is a property of subchunks below Y 40. Its used to make the underground more diverse.

- Crystal Cave
    - caves that spawn with glass/quarz/emerald/diamond blocks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/OhyFB2U.jpg)
- Granite/Diorite/Andesite Caves 
    - larger cave structures where this is the main stone block
- Spider Caves
    - Caves with cobwebs. in those sub chunks, only spiders can spawn.

### [3] Useless Gear

Most tools, weapon and armor is useless.

##### Tools and Weapons

- Wood Tools: Only usefull is a pickaxe to get to stone.
- Gold Tools: not worth it

**solution**

 - Remove Wood Tier
 - Stone Tools craftable from flint (additionally to stone)
 - Introduce bonies for higher
 - Gold Tools are crafted from the iron tool plus gold ingots plus iron nugget
    - (think of it as gilded tools)
    - durability 50% of iron
    - higher enchantability
        - efficiency 5 (without anvil)
        - unbreaking 4!
        - mining level of iron

##### Armors

| Armors | Leather | Gold | Chain | Iron | Diamond
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| strength | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| Expensive | 4/5 | 4/5 | (trading)5/5 | 2/5 | 4 / 5 |

Leather is hard to obtain, especially in the early game. When reaching iron you don't need it anymore.

**Solution**:

- Make Cows drop between 1-4 leather (instead 0-2) 
    - (rabbits hide drops up from 0-1 to 0-2). 
- Make Leather armor require a piece of wool to craft
    - the most central peace.
    - on boots the two upper leather are replaced by cloth
    - cannot be enchanted
- Make Iron Armor takes the respective piece of leather armor to craft
    - (think of it as lining)
    - cannot be enchanted
- Make Gold Armor as strong as Iron Armor
    - (think of it as gilded armor)
    - gilded armor can be enchanted
- Make Diamond Armor takes the respective piece of Iron Armor
    - (think of it as decorated/socketed)
    - diamond armor can be enchanted
    - diamond armor can't be repaired (except for mending)

### [Misc]

- Sword should always swing. (not only when hitting an enemy)
- Enemies shoul have attack animations ... cave spiders "biting" before jumping towards you :/
    - "how can you bite me? there is a gap between us that is larger than you are!"
    - fix cave spiders hitbox
- Cobwebs should be burnable
